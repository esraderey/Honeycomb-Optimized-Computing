# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for HOC, following the
[format proposed by Michael Nygard](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Why ADRs

Design decisions that took months of discussion should not evaporate into
Slack threads and PR comments. An ADR captures the *context*, *decision*,
and *consequences* of a non-trivial architectural choice so that a future
contributor (including future you) can reconstruct the reasoning without
excavating commit history.

## When to write one

Write an ADR when the team makes a decision that:

- Affects more than one module.
- Rules out alternatives that a reader would reasonably reach for.
- Has non-obvious tradeoffs or is likely to be revisited.
- Introduces or retires a dependency.
- Changes the shape of the public API.

You do NOT need an ADR for local refactors, small bug fixes, or decisions
fully explained by the code itself.
