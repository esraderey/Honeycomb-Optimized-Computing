"""
Drift detector — compares observed mutations against declared FSM specs.

For each FSM, attempts to bind it to an enum class found by the walker
(by member-name subset match). Then computes:

- **Undocumented mutations**: a mutation whose enum matches an FSM but
  whose target state is not declared in that FSM. **Error**.
- **Mutation against unbound enum**: a mutation whose enum does not
  match any FSM. **Error** (suggests the enum is missing a spec).
- **Dead states**: states declared in an FSM but no observed mutation
  targets them. **Warning** (the canary that catches B12-ter style
  dead-code in the enum).
- **Enum extras**: enum members not declared in the FSM (the canary
  that catches B12-bis: TaskState.ASSIGNED). **Warning**.
- **Declarative-only**: an FSM with no bound enum and no observed
  mutations. **Info** — fine for HOC's PheromoneDeposit / Succession
  / Failover, where the host object has no state field.

The bind heuristic: an FSM binds to an enum E iff every state in the
FSM is a member of E. If multiple enums satisfy this, the smallest
(by member count) wins; ties broken alphabetically by enum name.
